#### Previous Project Plan

Project contains 4 main sections:
* Background of the dataset
* Plot the dataset
* Descriptive statistics
* Explain why the dataset is interesting

An equal amount of time will be allocated to each section (however background of the dataset will probably be the quickest to complete)

I had intended to start this at the same time as the Programming for Data Analysis assignment but was unable to due to family and work commitments. Due to late start there is only 14 hours to complete. With Thursday and Friday it would be 18 hours. 


__Friday 2nd to Sunday 4th (Full days due to holidays) 24 hours * 0.33 = 8 hours__

* Friday start Plot the dataset
* Saturday start Descriptive statistics
* Sunday start Explain why the dataset is interesting


__Monday 5th to Friday 9th (Evenings only due to work - but may be able to take time off) 10 hours * 0.33 = 3 hours(with Thursday and Friday off work this would be 22 hours for the week * 0.33 = 7 hours)__

* By Friday be finished with Explain why the dataset is interesting and be finished with Backgroud of the dataset


__Saturday 10th (Full day) 8 hours = 3 hours__

Finish assignment
