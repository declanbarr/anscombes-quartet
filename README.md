# anscombes-quartet
An investigation into the Anscombe's Quartet datasets.

### What's contained in this repository

This repository contains the following files:

* anscombes-quartet.ipynb 
* Francis_Anscombe.jpeg
* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.md

The anscombes-quartet.ipynb file contains the analyses that was carried out into the Anscombe's Quartet datasets/

### How to run the Jupyter Notebook

For this project I used Anaconda version 5.3 and Python version 3.6.7. Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python used for data science.[1] Anaconda provides a number of libraries. For this project I will be using the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.

The datasets can be found [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/anscombe.csv). It isn't necessary to download the csv file in order to view the analyses that I've done as the script will read the csv file from the URL in the link given.

The anscombe-quartet.ipynb file can be viewed in full on GitHub or can be downloaded and run on your PC. To run on your own machine follow these steps:

* Download the raw .ipynb file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/declanbarr/anscombes-quartet/master/anscombes-quartet.ipynb
* On the command line change directory into the directory where you saved the ipynb file
* Start jupyter notebook by typing: jupyter notebook

If you wish to view the picture of Francis Anscombe in the notebook then you need to save the .jpeg file to the same folder as the ipynb file.

### Project plan

#### Updated Project Plan Friday 09/11/2018

Friday
* ~~Background of the dataset~~
* ~~Why the dataset is interesting~~

Saturday
* ~~Clean up code~~
* ~~Clean up descriptions ( add in proper referencing, etc)~~
* ~~Finish Readme~~
* ~~Add URL to Moodle page~~
* Review entire assignment (includes reading over PDF of assignment and rewatching video to ensure nothing has been missed)

Sunday
* Contingency day - Aim to have all work completed before this day


#### Previous Project Plan

Project contains 4 main sections:
* Background of the dataset
* Plot the dataset
* Descriptive statistics
* Explain why the dataset is interesting

An equal amount of time will be allocated to each section (however background of the dataset will probably be the quickest to complete)

I had intended to start this at the same time as the Programming for Data Analysis assignment but was unable to due to family and work commitments. Due to late start there is only 14 hours to complete. With Thursday and Friday it would be 18 hours. 


__Friday 2nd to Sunday 4th (Full days due to holidays) 24 hours * 0.33 = 8 hours__

* Friday start Plot the dataset
* Saturday start Descriptive statistics
* Sunday start Explain why the dataset is interesting


__Monday 5th to Friday 9th (Evenings only due to work - but may be able to take time off) 10 hours * 0.33 = 3 hours(with Thursday and Friday off work this would be 22 hours for the week * 0.33 = 7 hours)__

* By Friday be finished with Explain why the dataset is interesting and be finished with Backgroud of the dataset


__Saturday 10th (Full day) 8 hours = 3 hours__

Finish assignment
